**Introduction:**

The CSUF Problem Solving Seminar traditionally engages our interested
undergraduate students as they prepare for the William Lowell Putnam
Competition. Besides the content similar to these programs, we are discussing
problems from various journals, including The American Mathematical Monthly,
Mathematics Magazine, the College Mathematical Journal, Gazeta matematicÄƒ, or
the Mathematical Gazette (London).
