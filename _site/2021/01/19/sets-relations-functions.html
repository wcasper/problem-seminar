<meta name="description" content="Sets, Relations, and Functions Sets The notion of a set is the foundation of all of formal mathematics. Intuitively, a set is a collection of objects (called elements), like the set of all positive real numbers, or the set of all letters in the English alphabet. However, we cannot explicitly define what a set is, due to introduction of various paradoxes that inevitably result such as Russell’s paradox. Instead, we pull a very clever run-around by forgoing any definition of what a set is and instead simply describing how it behaves. These behaviors are encoded in terms of a set of rules called axioms. In this course, we will adopt the ZFC-axomatic system for sets, which includes the axiom of choice. Furthermore, by and large the intuitive definition of a set will be sufficiently rigorous for the purposes of our presentation. We assume that students have some familiarity with sets from previous math courses. Still we present a very brief review of some of the basic notation and ideas. Examples of sets include [\begin{align} A &amp;= {1,2,3,a,b,c} B &amp;= {x: \text{$x$ is a real number and}\ 0\leq x \leq 2} \end{align}] The first set is in list notation, where the elements of the set are simply listed out. The second set is in set builder notation, where the elements are determined by a specified condition. A very important special example of a set is the empty set \(\varnothing\) , which is the set not containing any elements. We use the notation \(x\in A\) to mean that \(x\) is an element of the set \(A\). The notation \(A\subseteq B\) means that \(A\) is a subset of \(B\), ie that every element of \(A\) is also an element of \(B\). There are several ways of building new sets from old ones by means of various set-theoretic operations. Important examples include union \[A\cup B = \{x:x\in A\ \text{or}\ x\in B\}\] intersection \[A\cap B = \{x:x\in A\ \text{and}\ x\in B\}\] cartesian product \[A\times B = \{(x,y): x\in A\ \text{and}\ y\in B\}\] power set \[\mathcal P(A) = \{C: \text{$C$ is a subset of $A$}\}\] A partition of a set \(A\) is a collection of subsets of \(A\) whose union forms all of \(A\). Relations In mathematics, we are constantly trying to identify patterns and relationships, for example the relationship between \(x\) and \(y\)-coordinates in a parabola \(y=x^2\). As such, it is imperative to have a formal way of describing various relationships. One very slick way of accomplishing this is via the notion of a relation. Definition: A relation from a set \(A\) to a set \(B\) is a subset \(\mathscr R\) of the cartesian product \(A\times B\). If \(A=B\), then we say \(\mathscr R\) is a relation on \(A\).\(\) Notation-wise, we write \(a\mathscr Rb\) to mean that \((a,b)\in\mathscr R\). Note that we don’t have to use a fancy R to denote a relation. You can often see relations denoted by \(\sim\) or \(\equiv\), or even a letter like \(f\). The choice of notation typically depends on the context or on the kind of relation we are dealing with. The tremendous flexibility of the concept of a relation allows is immediately apparent via the very diverse roles they play. Let’s see some examples: Example: Let \(P\) be the set of all living people in the world. We define a relation \(\mathscr R\) on \(P\) by saying \(x\mathscr Ry\) if \(x\) and \(y\) have a biological parent in common. Thus for example (Venus Williams)\(\mathscr R\)(Serena Williams). Example: Let \(A=\{a,b,c,d\}\) and \(B = \{1,2,3,4\}\) and \(\mathscr R = \{(a,3),(b,2),(b,3)\}\). Then \(\mathscr R\) is an equivalence relation from \(A\) to \(B\). For example \(a\mathscr R3\) and \(b\mathscr R2\). Example: Let \(B\) be the set of all published books. Define a relation \(\mathscr R\) from \(B\) to \(\mathbb N\) by saying \(x\mathscr R n\) if and only if \(n\) is the number of pages in book \(x\). In the special case that \(\mathscr R\) is an equivalence relation on \(A\), we are typically interested in three specific properties. Definition: We call \(\mathscr R\) reflexive if \(x\mathscr Rx\) for all \(x\in A\) symmetric if \(x\mathscr R y\) implies \(y\mathscr R x\) for all \(x,y\in A\) transitive if \(x\mathscr R y\) and \(y\mathscr R z\) implies \(x\mathscr R z\) for all \(x,y,z\in A\) A relation \(\mathscr R\) on \(A\) which is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive is called an equivalence relation. In this case, we define the equivalence class of an element \(a\in A\) to be [[a] = {x\in A: a\mathscr Rx}] The set of equivalence classes forms a partition of \(A\). In fact, there is a natural one-to-one correspondence between partitions and equivalence classes. Note that the first example above is actually an example of an equivalence relation. Functions Functions are very familiar to us from our exploration in previous math courses. The true, formal definition of functions is in terms of relations with special properties. Definition: A relation \(f\) from \(A\) to \(B\) is a function if it satisfies the property that for every \(a\in A\) there exists a unique \(b\in B\) satisfying \(afb\). In this case, we usually use a specialized notation \(f: A\rightarrow B\) to mean \(f\) is a function from \(A\) to \(B\) and write \(f(a)=b\) in place of \(afb\). Example: The relation \(\mathscr R\) from \(\mathbb Z\) to \([0,\infty)\) defined by saying \(n\mathscr Rx\) if and only if \(n=x^2\) is not a function. This is because there is no \(x\) such that \(-1\mathscr R x\) Example: The relation \(\mathscr R\) from \(\mathbb N\) to \(\mathbb R\) defined by saying \(n\mathscr Rx\) if and only if \(n=x^2\) is not a function because there is more than one value of \(x\) satisfying \(1\mathscr Rx\), namely \(x=1\) and \(x=-1\). Example: The relation \(\mathscr R\) from \(\mathbb N\) to \([0,\infty)\) defined by saying \(n\mathscr Rx\) if and only if \(n=x^2\) is a function because every \(n\) has a unique \(x\) satisfying \(n\mathscr Rx\). In this case, we could also have defined the relation in functional notation \(f: \mathbb N\rightarrow [0,\infty]\) by defining \(f(n)=\sqrt{n}\). As we know, we are often interested in various properties of the function, such as injectivity, surjectivity, or bijectivity. Definition: A function \(f: A\rightarrow B\) is called injective or one-to-one if for all \(a_1,a_2\in A\) with \(a_1\neq a_2\) we have \(f(a_1)\neq f(a_2)\). In other words, \(f\) never maps different elements to the same place surjective or onto if for all \(b\in B\) there exists \(a\in A\) with \(f(a)=b\) bijective if it is both injective and surjective" />

<h3 id="sets">Sets</h3>

<p>The notion of a <strong>set</strong> is the foundation of all of formal mathematics.  Intuitively, a set is a collection of objects (called elements), like the set of all positive real numbers, or the set of all letters in the English alphabet.  However, we cannot explicitly define what a set is, due to introduction of various paradoxes that inevitably result such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox">Russell’s paradox</a>.  Instead, we pull a very clever run-around by forgoing any definition of what a set is and instead simply describing how it behaves.  These behaviors are encoded in terms of a set of rules called <strong>axioms</strong>.  In this course, we will adopt the ZFC-axomatic system for sets, which includes the axiom of choice.  Furthermore, by and large the intuitive definition of a set will be sufficiently rigorous for the purposes of our presentation.</p>

<p>We assume that students have some familiarity with sets from previous math courses.  Still we present a very brief review of some of the basic notation and ideas.</p>

<p>Examples of sets include</p>

\[\begin{align*}
A &amp;= \{1,2,3,a,b,c\}\\
B &amp;= \{x: \text{$x$ is a real number and}\ 0\leq x \leq 2\}
\end{align*}\]

<p>The first set is in list <strong>notation</strong>, where the elements of the set are simply listed out.  The second set is in <strong>set builder notation</strong>, where the elements are determined by a specified condition.  A very important special example of a set is the <strong>empty set</strong> \(\varnothing\) , which is the set not containing any elements.</p>

<p>We use the notation \(x\in A\) to mean that \(x\) is an element of the set \(A\).  The notation \(A\subseteq B\) means that \(A\) is a <strong>subset</strong> of \(B\), ie that every element of \(A\) is also an element of \(B\).</p>

<p>There are several ways of building new sets from old ones by means of various set-theoretic operations.  Important examples include</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>union</strong></p>

\[A\cup B = \{x:x\in A\ \text{or}\ x\in B\}\]
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>intersection</strong></p>

\[A\cap B = \{x:x\in A\ \text{and}\ x\in B\}\]
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>cartesian product</strong></p>

\[A\times B = \{(x,y): x\in A\ \text{and}\ y\in B\}\]
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>power set</strong></p>

\[\mathcal P(A) = \{C: \text{$C$ is a subset of $A$}\}\]
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A <strong>partition</strong> of a set \(A\) is a collection of subsets of \(A\) whose union forms all of \(A\).</p>

As such, it is imperative to have a formal way of describing various relationships.  One very slick way of accomplishing this is via the notion of a relation.</p>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A <strong>relation from a set \(A\) to a set \(B\)</strong> is a subset \(\mathscr R\) of the cartesian product \(A\times B\).  If \(A=B\), then we say \(\mathscr R\) is a <strong>relation on \(A\).\(\)</strong>  Notation-wise, we write \(a\mathscr Rb\) to mean that \((a,b)\in\mathscr R\).</p>

<p>Note that we don’t have to use a fancy R to denote a relation.  You can often see relations denoted by \(\sim\) or \(\equiv\), or even a letter like \(f\).  The choice of notation typically depends on the context or on the <em>kind</em> of relation we are dealing with.  The tremendous flexibility of the concept of a relation allows is immediately apparent via the very diverse roles they play.  Let’s see some examples:</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Let \(P\) be the set of all living people in the world.  We define a relation \(\mathscr R\) on \(P\) by saying \(x\mathscr Ry\) if \(x\) and \(y\) have a biological parent in common.  Thus for example (Venus Williams)\(\mathscr R\)(Serena Williams).</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Let \(A=\{a,b,c,d\}\) and \(B = \{1,2,3,4\}\) and \(\mathscr R = \{(a,3),(b,2),(b,3)\}\).  Then \(\mathscr R\) is an equivalence relation from \(A\) to \(B\).  For example \(a\mathscr R3\) and \(b\mathscr R2\).</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong>  Let \(B\) be the set of all published books.  Define a relation \(\mathscr R\) from \(B\) to \(\mathbb N\) by saying \(x\mathscr R n\) if and only if \(n\) is the number of pages in book \(x\).</p>

<p>In the special case that \(\mathscr R\) is an equivalence relation on \(A\), we are typically interested in three specific properties.</p>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong>   We call \(\mathscr R\)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>reflexive</strong> if \(x\mathscr Rx\) for all \(x\in A\)</li>
  <li><strong>symmetric</strong> if \(x\mathscr R y\) implies \(y\mathscr R x\) for all \(x,y\in A\)</li>
  <li><strong>transitive</strong> if \(x\mathscr R y\) and \(y\mathscr R z\) implies \(x\mathscr R z\) for all \(x,y,z\in A\)</li>
</ul>

<p>A relation \(\mathscr R\) on \(A\) which is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive is called an <strong>equivalence relation</strong>.  In this case, we define the <strong>equivalence class</strong> of an element \(a\in A\) to be</p>

\[[a] = \{x\in A: a\mathscr Rx\}\]

<p>The set of equivalence classes forms a partition of \(A\).  In fact, there is a natural one-to-one correspondence between partitions and equivalence classes.  Note that the first example above is actually an example of an equivalence relation.</p>

<h3 id="functions">Functions</h3>

<p>Functions are very familiar to us from our exploration in previous math courses.  The true, formal definition of functions is in terms of relations with special properties.</p>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A relation \(f\) from \(A\) to \(B\) is a <strong>function</strong> if it satisfies the property that for every \(a\in A\) there exists a unique \(b\in B\) satisfying \(afb\).  In this case, we usually use a specialized notation \(f: A\rightarrow B\) to mean \(f\) is a function from \(A\) to \(B\) and write \(f(a)=b\) in place of \(afb\).</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong>  The relation \(\mathscr R\) from \(\mathbb Z\) to \([0,\infty)\) defined by saying \(n\mathscr Rx\) if and only if \(n=x^2\) is <em>not</em> a function.  This is because there is no \(x\) such that \(-1\mathscr R x\)</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong>  The relation \(\mathscr R\) from \(\mathbb N\) to \(\mathbb R\) defined by saying \(n\mathscr Rx\) if and only if \(n=x^2\) is <em>not</em> a function because there is more than one value of \(x\) satisfying \(1\mathscr Rx\), namely \(x=1\) and \(x=-1\).</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong>  The relation \(\mathscr R\) from \(\mathbb N\) to \([0,\infty)\) defined by saying \(n\mathscr Rx\) if and only if \(n=x^2\) is a function because every \(n\) has a unique \(x\) satisfying \(n\mathscr Rx\).  In this case, we could also have defined the relation in functional notation \(f: \mathbb N\rightarrow [0,\infty]\) by defining \(f(n)=\sqrt{n}\).</p>

<p>As we know, we are often interested in various properties of the function, such as injectivity, surjectivity, or bijectivity.</p>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A function \(f: A\rightarrow B\) is called</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>injective</strong> or <strong>one-to-one</strong> if for all \(a_1,a_2\in A\) with \(a_1\neq a_2\) we have \(f(a_1)\neq f(a_2)\).  In other words, \(f\) never maps different elements to the same place</li>
  <li><strong>surjective</strong> or <strong>onto</strong> if for all \(b\in B\) there exists \(a\in A\) with \(f(a)=b\)</li>
  <li><strong>bijective</strong> if it is both injective and surjective</li>
</ul>
