\textbf{\color{cprimary}Thinking about applying to graduate school in math?} You probably have a lot of questions.  How do you find the right schools to apply?  What does the application process and experience look like?  What is it like being in graduate school?
In recent years, students from CSUF have obtained positions in graduate schools all around the country!  Their recent experience with the process of applying to graduate schools (and beyond) could be a very useful tool in your personal mathematical journey.  In this panel you will have the opportunity to get some answers from a wide group of recent graduates from the CSUF math department.  Come and listen or bring your own pressing graduate school questions!

{\textbf{\color{csecondary}ABOUT THE SEMINAR}}\par
}
\normalsize
\smallskip

\textbf{\color{cprimary}The CSUF Problem Solving Seminar} traditionally engages our interested undergraduate students as they prepare for
the William Lowell Putnam Competition. Besides the content similar to these programs, we are discussing problems
from various journals, including The American Mathematical Monthly, Mathematics Magazine, the College
Mathematical Journal, Gazeta matematicÄƒ, or the Mathematical Gazette (London).
